	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run relative to the input size. It helps us evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm by providing an upper bound on its running time. An algorithm with a low time complexity is considered more efficient as it will perform better even for large input sizes.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It evaluates the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the space required to process the input. For example, if an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
